                <p>Michelle is a true example of the values and ideals that GIFT aspires to. Having been educated at Haberdashers she took a gap year to study at Brovender’s Seminary in Jerusalem before gaining an undergraduate degree in Psychology from Manchester, an MA in Social Work from Brunel University and an MA in Psychotherapy and Counselling from Regents College.</p>

                <div class="banner-testimonial-description">
                    <p>
                        Shocked by the volume of wasted food in supermarkets and restaurants and inspired by R’Naftali Schiff’s vision, GIFT started from Michelle’s kitchen table in 2004, gathering excess bread from bakeries each week and redistributing it to struggling families whilst continuing her work as a probation officer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, very soon it became apparent that her passion for giving and her need to inspire others, were too strong and Michelle became GIFT’s very first employee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        15 years later that passion has created an organisation that has left an indelible mark on the Jewish community and the name Michelle Barnett synonymous with giving. The opportunities and acts of giving that GIFT has created now rank in their hundreds of thousands. Hundreds of families in need across the community have benefited from the thousands of hours that GIFT’s army of volunteers have given, supporting them in numerous important ways.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In her personal life, Michelle’s long-suffering husband Danny has supported her in dedicating much of her married life to GIFT whilst also successfully raised their 3 talented children, all who are deeply imbued with a sense of giving, making Michelle the embodiment of the phrase - To Live is to Give.
